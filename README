This code mimics the logic that would happen inside of EA's NHL 12 when one creates their EASHL player. 

FAQ: 

Q: So I created my guy with your tool. How do I import him into the game? 
A: This tool is for planning purpose only. You cannot import your player into NHL 12. 
You will have to navigate the game menus and create your character there. 

Q: So, can I put this on my website? 
A: Of course!

Q: How would I go about doing that? 
A: See the reference playercreator.html file for an example usage of the code. You'll 
have to include jQuery 1.6.2, the attached playercreator.js file and the jquery.base64.min.js 
plugin into your webpage. Then, simply call "new PlayerCreator({render_to : "some_div"});" 
In this example, "some_div" is a div with the id of "some_div" that is located on your page. 
You must specify the "render_to" option.

Q: I don't have a website. I just want to use the damn thing. How do I do that? 
A: Simply download the project's zip file to your computer. Then un-zip it with your favorite
zipping program. Then simply double click on "playercreator.html".

Q: Do I need to show the credits on my page? 
A: No. You can pass in "credits : false" in the options in order to not show the credits message. It's
okay, I won't judge you.

Q: Does this have goalie attributes? 
A: Yes it does! It has goalie boosts as well. 

Q: I created a player with your tool but my overall isn't the same as what's reported in the game. 
A: This is a known issue. The overall calculation inside of NHL 12 includes some attributes that 
you cannot edit (i.e. Poise). If someone were to give me the hidden attributes and their values, then
I may update the tool to accurately calculate the average. 

Q: Can I report bugs or suggest features? 
A: Of course. Either do so on the github page or message me via XBL. I don't log onto the PSN anymore. 

Q: What features are you planning on adding? 
A: In the near future, I will add the support for linkable builds (just like last year) so you can share your
build with others and allow them to edit your build in place. I'm also planning on adding different output formats 
for sharing a read-only view of your build with others. The formats will include text and bbcode. I may also add the 
boost pack info to the tool.
